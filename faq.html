				<h3>What do I do if my bike gets a flat tire?</h3>
				<p>If you get a flat tire or any other issue arrises with your bike or scooter, simply call: 0800 236 107, and we will send someone 
				down to fix your problem, give a refund, or whatever else is required to rectify the situation.</p>

				<h3>What if I no longer what to rent?</h3>
				<p>If you have changed your mind or something has come up, depending on the situation we may grant a refund or a partial refund.
				It is expected that if you say you will take the bike for x amount of hours that you will at least pay that amount. If there is an
				event that is out of your control we may give a refund as mentioned before. If you change your mind a hour before taking the bike
				or scooter out, then you will be eligible for a full refund or not asked to pay.</p>

			<div class="content3">
				<h3>What if I have an accident?</h3>
				<p>If you have an accident, and are hurt, then the first thing you should do is dial 111 as your health is more important than
				the bikes. If you are okay and the bike is damaged then call 0800 236 107 and we will come and pick you and the bike (or scooter)
				up. You may be liable for the damages depending on what has happened. If you are using the bike in an environment it is not suited
				for (like using a road bike on a mountain track) then you will be required to pay for the damages. Every situation is assessed case 
				by case.</p>

				<h3>What if I want to pick up my bike from a different location?</h3>
				<p>If you want to pick up your rental from a different location to the ones listed on the previous page, then you will be required
				to either contact us 24 hours before to arrange for one of our staff bring the rental to the location you want. It will come with a
				$20 (NZD) travel fee. If you request this under the 24 hour limit, then you will be required to pay a $30 fee. This is the same for
				returning the rentals.</p>
